Hi, I\'m Alex, a frontend developer with a passion for web development and a strong focus on delivering high-quality work. I currently work at an advertising agency, where I build the front-end of websites, collaborating with backend developers to bring projects to completion. I love the immediacy of web developmentâ€”seeing my work take shape in real-time and constantly pushing myself to improve.
\n
I began my career in a completely different field, working as a microbiologist and technologist in the pharmaceutical industry. While I enjoyed certain aspects of the job, I felt the work lacked the creativity I was seeking. This led me to pursue a career in web development, where I started by learning JavaScript through online courses. Over time, I expanded my skills and began working on freelance projects, creating websites using WordPress and then moving on to more advanced front-end technologies.
\n
After gaining experience with various projects, I joined a small team at an advertising agency as a front-end developer. In my time there, I\'ve completed over 20 projects and further honed my skills. I\'ve completed three professional courses in JavaScript, including "Professional Web Interface Development," "Client-Side Application Architecture," and "React: Developing Complex Client Applications." I\'m currently focused on mastering Next.js and aim to use my skills to build even more dynamic and interactive websites and web applications.
\n
Outside of development, I enjoy customizing my work environment and staying organized, as well as continuously improving my English skills. I also like to stay active, hitting the gym regularly for strength training.
\n
In the future, I plan to apply my React knowledge to create even more sophisticated websites and start working with React Native for mobile app development.
